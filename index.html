  <p>Hello to my dear visitors! This is my first website created in Github. Something about myself that I would like to talk about is my hobbies. 
      I like building gaming rigs, play volleyball and do a little bit of photography. 
      These are the three things that keep me occupied and something to look forward for the weekends. </p>

  <p> Build gaming rigs is probably the easiest and less effort since it just takes research. I used to research more on compatibilities, availability and best deals but recently it has been easier to find all the components I want. With the exception of the video cards, using various websites helps in PC building. This is where I find most of the computer components I need when building gaming PCs.

  <p> Playing volleyball is where I find most of the fun and excitement. I trained and joined several tournaments to develop my skills. I also watch professional games online and learn techniques. This is where I watch volleyball games. By the way, France is my favorite Team and Earvin Ngapeth is my favorite player. </p>
