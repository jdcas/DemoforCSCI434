<p> Embedded Youtube URL
  <p> I posted a youtube URL below which about Learning how to use Camera. Embedding Youtube URL could cause issues due to compatibility and security issues that youtube       may block my website from embedding the URL </p>
    
  <p> <<iframe width="1227" height="690" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YojL7UQTVhc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  <p> Embedded video </p>
  
  <p> The video below is the same as the embedded Youtube URL but this one is downloaded instead. This is the easiest way to embed a video since it won't cause compatibility or security issue. The only thing problem I ran into is I the file size limit. </p>
